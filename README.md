# Web accessibility checklist
This checklist was made following [WCAG 2.0 Checklist](https://www.wuhcag.com/wcag-checklist/)

## Level A (Beginner)
- [] Add *alt* property to all images, audio, video or controls (such as ‘Search’ or ‘Submit’)
- There are a few types of image that don’t need alt text: spacers, icons, purely decorative, tests and CAPTCHA images.

- [x] Write text transcripts to all audion-only media or video-only media
- If the content is itself an alternative (you don’t have to provide a transcript of the audio track you provided to explain the silent video you used)

- [ ] Provide captions for videos with audio
- [ ] Provide a full text transcript of the video
- [ ] Provide a version of the video with audio description
- If the video is itself an alternative.
- You don’t need an audio description if all of the information in the video is provided in the regular soundtrack

- [ ] Mark headings with HTML header tags
- Headings on a web page are a great way to break up content and show your users the relative importance of each section. 

- [ ] Use the correct HTML for all structural elements
- An efficient way to check your markup is to use a HTML validator. This will tell you if the web page structure has any HTML errors – these errors won’t always equate to accessibility flaws but the cleaner your code the better. Errors like improperly closed paragraph tags are easily remedied

- [ ] Use clear labels on forms
- [ ] Break up content with subheadings for new sections
- [ ] Present content in a meaningful order
- Turn off the site’s Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) and check that your web page displays in the correct order. 

- [ ] Separate navigation menus from content
- [ ] Use paragraphs in order
- [ ] Use headings to show importance
- [ ] Choose whether a list needs numbering or not
- [ ] Use valid HTML and check it with the W3C’s markup validator.15
- [ ] Don’t have any audio that plays automatically
- [ ] Unplug your mouse and make sure you can fully use your website with your keyboard (eg:. tab or arrowkeys)
- [ ] Make sure no function on your website requires timed keystrokes – such as double tap enter/return within two seconds to submit
- [ ] Make sure that *outline* property is not *none*
- [ ] Be wary of third-party adverts and widgets, often these are not accessible
- [ ] If your website has moving or animated text, users must be able to pause the movement
- [ ] If your website has a feature that updates automatically (for example, with the latest football scores), you must allow your users to delay the frequency of the updates by at least ten times the default setting.
- [ ] If your website uses a time limit:
  - [ ] Give your users an option to turn off the time limit before it begins (for example, a landing page before the time-controlled page can display a message that shows your customers what to do); or
  - [ ] Give your users the option to adjust the time limit before it begins, over a range of at least ten times the default setting (you can do this with a landing page too); or
  - [ ] Give your users the option to extend the period at least twenty seconds before it expires. This must be a simple action like clicking a button and must be available to use at least ten times.
- You do not need to provide the above controls if:
  -The time limit is due to real-time events, like bidding in an auction.
  - Your content is a live video stream.
  - The time limit is essential for your business. For example, a ticket sales website that saves a reservation for ten minutes because demand is high and giving users unlimited time would undermine the business process.
  - The time limit is more than 20 hours.
